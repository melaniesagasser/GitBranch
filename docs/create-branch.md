# Creating a Branch

Create a branch in the GitHub web UI that's subordinate to the main branch.

## Prerequisites

- You have a GitHub account and are logged in.
- You have access to the repository where you want to create the branch.

## Steps

1. In your GitHub repository, make sure you’re on the **Code** tab.
2. Check that the branch menu under the repository title shows the `main` branch. If you’re not on `main`, select it from the branch menu.
1. Click the branch menu to open the **Switch branches/tags** dropdown menu.
2. In the entry field with the search icon, enter a name for your new child branch.
3. In the **Branches** tab of the dropdown, click **Create branch `<branch-name>` from main**.

## Result

- You’re automatically switched to the branch you've just created.  
- Both the `main` branch and your new branch are now displayed in the repository.
