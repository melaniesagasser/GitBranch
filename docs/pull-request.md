# Opening a Pull Request

Open a pull request to merge your committed changes into the main branch.

## Prerequisite

- You're in the child branch and you're committed changes to it.
- On the **Code** or **Pull requests** tab, you get a highlighted message box about the last pushes (that is, committed changes).

## Steps

1. In the message box about the last pushes, click the **Compare & pull request** button.
2. Check the changes that are displayed at the bottom of the page.
3. *Optional:* Add a comment to the pull request.
4. Click **Create pull request**.

## Result

The pull request is created and ready to be merged by a repository administrator. For all the repositories that you create, you automatically have administrative rights.
